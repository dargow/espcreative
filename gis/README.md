# gis v.0.0.2
## a minetest mod for producing surface imagery and derivatives like slope and aspect
## development of this mod has ceased and has been incorporated into realterrain mod:
https://github.com/bobombolo/realterrain

What it does:

the map is not for navigation (don't compare to minimap), it is for displaying calculated surface properties. eventually these properties will be used for a sort of biome generator that accounts for terrain, proximity to water, etc. so eventually these derivatives will not even be displayed.

hillshade and curvature don't work correctly, other maps not at all at this point...
